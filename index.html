		<h3 class="mv--up">3. Three.js</h3>
		<div class="measure">
		<p class="txt--left">Three.js one the most successful open source projects of recent years, and by far the most popular WebGL framework in use today. It's seen by many as a victory of the open web, of open standards that came about after years of relying on closed platforms like Adobe Flash.

 		</div>
 		<p class="txt--left">Of the three frameworks being compared, Three.js is the only one without explicit commercial sponsorship. As the project grows older, incentivising developers to maintain it could be seen as an issue. However, the number of commercial apps and demos that rely on the library (Google, Apple, Autodesk, Vizor) mean that it will be maintained rigorously for the near future. As WebGL and the browser landscape are rapidly evolving, this is an important consideration. Any framework you choose will need to adapt to the coming changes of WebVR + WebGL 2.0, while maintaining a stable and consistent API. This will require a strong community of contributers and developers.

 		 <p class="txt--left">Aside from its community and adoption, Three.js's strength is in its feature set and extensibility. Though plenty of utilities and helpers exist, the core library excludes features such as keyboard + mouse events and physics. This makes it less appropriate for a large scale game framework, but appropriate for a general purpose graphics library. 
 		</p>
		<div class="txt--left">Strengths
			<ul>
				<li>Large community and ecosystem</li>
				<li>Very customisable, makes sense for a large variety of non-gaming applications</li>

			Weaknesses
			<ul>
				<li>Doesn't follow semver, changes often breaking</li>
				<li>Harder to set up, many ways of achieving the same goal - higher barrier to entry</li>

		<div class="measure txt--left"><h3 class="txt--center pad">4. Goo Engine</h3>
			<p>
				Goo Engine is the open source WebGL library that powers Goo Create, a browser based GUI designed to allow you to create interactive scenes without coding.
				Goo is the newest framework of the three, and only became open source in November 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				Goo Engine's API shares a lot in common with Three.js, possibly starting as a fork of Three.js
			</p>
			<div class="txt--center">
			<img src="./img/goo-authorship.jpg" alt=""/><br>
					<i>drama!</i>
			</div>
	
			<p> If it started as a fork, a lot of work has been done since then. An overview of the changes are that many of the features from Three.js have been stripped out, multiple renderers, material types, loaders and primitives, and added to framework are mouse and keyboard helpers, as well as a physics engine, cannon.js. These design decisions are in line with the goal of making the framework as accessible as possible for people to create games and experiences, and minimising the amount of code that needs to be written.
			</p>
			<p>
			Goo Engine has definitely been built for the purpose of tight integration with its online GUI editor, Goo Create. It does what it sets out to very well, and its ease of use has attracted a talented community who have used the engine & Goo Create to make some of the best WebGL demos on the internet.

			<p>
				Play Canvas is a graphics library that has been built primarily for gaming, however the focus has shifted to include archviz and other commercial applications. 
				Like Goo, it provides keyboard events and physics out of the box, however the API feels a lot easier to navigate.

				<li>Built in Keyboard + Mouse Events, rigid body physics</li>

			</ul>
			Weaknesses

		<div class="measure">
		<p>
			As all three frameworks are JS libraries that sit on top of WebGL, you can achieve the same things with any of them, with enough effort. It's hard to compare performance, but if the GPU is rendering the same shaders, number of triangles per-frame, and keeping the same textures in memory, the performance discrepency should be minimal. It makes sense then to choose a framework that aligns well with your philosophy, workflow and project intentions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of Playcanvas's recent focus on arch-viz it would seem like a good choice for an architectural application. However, as Playcanvas as a product is heavily focused and invested in its editor, it doesn't make sense to use the engine without the editor, when there are single focus solutions available. Both the editor and engine will be influenced by each other as the product develops. With regards to arch-viz, Playcanvas seems more suited to the creation of one-off arch-viz experiences, rather than the creation of a system for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Goo Engine's main strength is also in its editor. One consideration regarding this is that that puts it in competition with other editors like Unity, and Unreal - who have WebGL exporters, and will possibly the first to utilise new technologies like emscripten and WebAssembly. Goo's declarative approach could be a very real positive, but the API, or at least the documentation, needs some tweaks to lower the barrier to entry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Three.js makes the most sense as the framework to use for an architectural application. It's more purpose-agnostic, and the community around it ensures that will continue to be maintained. The addition of big players like Autodesk building applications on top of Three.js show how dominant it's become, but also present a challenge. The framework needs to adapt rapidly to new web APIs and WebGL 2.0, and still release and maintain stable updates. Three.js is not the perfect framework, and it's possible a better designed framework might arise, or that Goo Engine / Play Canvas might pick up enough momuntum to become more feasible as an application framework.

			All three are fantastic in their own way, it's great to have choices, and great that open source software can be so successful.
