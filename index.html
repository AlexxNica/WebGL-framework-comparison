	<!-- 3. Three.js -->
	<section class="measure bg--gray txt--center p2">
		<h3 class="mv--up">3. Three.js</h3>
		<div class="measure">
		<p class="txt--left">Three.js is one the most successful open source projects of recent years, and by far the most popular WebGL framework in use today. It's seen by many as a victory of the open web, and of open standards that came about after years of relying on closed platforms like Adobe Flash.
 		</p>

 		</div>
 		<p class="txt--left">Of the three frameworks being compared, Three.js is the only one without explicit commercial sponsorship. As the project grows older, incentivising developers to maintain it could be seen as an issue. However, the number of commercial apps and demos that rely on the library (Google, Apple, Autodesk, Vizor) mean that it will be maintained rigorously for the near future. As WebGL and the browser landscape are rapidly evolving, this is an important consideration. Any framework you choose will need to adapt to the coming changes of WebVR + WebGL 2.0, while maintaining a stable and consistent API.

 		</div>
 		 <p class="txt--left">Aside from its community and adoption, Three.js's strength is in its feature set and extensibility. Though plenty of utilities and helpers exist (for example a webVR renderer, ray tracing demos, first person controls etc), the core library excludes features such as keyboard + mouse events and physics. This makes it less appropriate for hobbyist game creators and people needing a quick set up, but appropriate for a general purpose graphics library. 
 		</p>
		<div class="txt--left">Strengths
			<ul>
				<li>Large community and ecosystem</li>
				<li>Very customisable, makes sense for a variety of non-gaming applications</li>
				<li>Documentation and examples are easy to use</li>
			</ul>
			Weaknesses
			<ul>
				<li>Doesn't follow semver, changes are often breaking</li>
				<li>Harder to set up, many ways of achieving the same goal - higher barrier to entry</li>
				<li>Imperative API, philosophy at odds with the approach of front-end frameworks like React + Rx</li>
				<li>Could potentially be bogged down by the number of users who depend on it, causing a rift in the community, see Node.js + iojs fork</li>

	<!-- 4. Goo Engine -->
	<section class="bg--light-gray p2">
		<div class="measure txt--left"><h3 class="txt--center pad">4. Goo Engine</h3>
			<p>
				Goo Engine is the open source WebGL library that powers Goo Create, a browser based GUI designed to allow you to create interactive scenes without coding.
				Goo is the newest framework of the three, and only became open source in November 2015.
			</p>
			<p>
				Goo Engine's API shares a lot in common with Three.js, possibly starting as a fork of Three.js
			</p>
			<div class="txt--center">
			<img src="./img/goo-authorship.jpg" alt=""/><br>
					<i>drama!</i>
			</div>
	
			<p> If it started as a fork, a lot of work has been done since then. An overview of the changes are that many of the features from Three.js have been stripped out, multiple renderers, material types, loaders and primitives, and in their place are single generic primitives. Added to the framework are mouse and keyboard helpers, as well as a physics engine, cannon.js. These design decisions are in line with the goal of making the framework as accessible as possible for people to create games and experiences, and minimising the amount of code that needs to be written.
			</p>
			<p>
			Goo Engine has been built with the purpose of tight integration with its online GUI editor, Goo Create. It does what it sets out to very well, and its ease of use has attracted a talented community who have used the engine & Goo Create to make some of the best WebGL demos on the internet.

			</div>

			<div>Strengths
			<ul>
				<li>Visual Editor, great for editing materials / understanding scene hierachy</li>
				<li>Animation</li>
				<li>Entity System</li>
				<li>Built in Keyboard + Mouse Events, rigid body physics</li>
				<li>Developers working professionally on the engine</li>
			</ul>
			Weaknesses
			<ul>
				<li>The API is more declarative than the other two, which would be good if the documentation / API was better. Though the Goo Engine hello world example had the fewest lines of code, it took hours of looking through the docs just to figure out how to make basic changes to the viewport size / color</li>
				<li>User friendly features have come at the cost of extensibility, suits a certain type of project (i.e. game / experience, but not necessarily an Architectural application)</li>
				<li>Doesn't make sense to use independent of Goo Create, which is great, but proprietry + not free</li>

	<!-- 5. PlayCanvas -->
	<section class="bg--grey p2">		
		<div class="measure txt--left"><h3 class="txt--center pad">5. PlayCanvas</h3>
			<p>
				PlayCanvas is a graphics library that has been built primarily for gaming, however the focus has shifted to include archviz and other commercial applications. 
				Like Goo, it provides keyboard events and physics out of the box, however the API feels a lot easier to navigate, and customising the hello world example was simple.
			</p>
			<div class="txt--center">
			<img src="./img/play.jpg" alt=""/><br>
			</div>
			<p>A big difference between Goo Engine and PlayCanvas is that the engine contains wrappers around the browsers native HTTP and WebSockets API. Several of the demos on the PlayCanvas homepage are multiplayer experience, and work reliably. Tanx is one example, it has been played nearly 2 million times making it one of the most popular WebGL games on the internet.</p>
			<div>Strengths
			<ul>
				<li>Networking / Multi user capabilities if using PlayCanvas platform to distribute / build app</li>
				<li>Excellent documentation + tutorial resources</li>
				<li>Built in Keyboard + Mouse Events, rigid body physics</li>
				<li>Developers working professionally on the engine</li>
			</ul>
			Weaknesses
			<ul>
				<li>Suits creation of one-off experiences rather than the creation of a platform</li>
				<li>Editor is proprietry</li>
				<li>Community is good, but mostly focused on using the editor. It can be confusing looking through forum posts / questions for help, as it's often not clear whether the editor or the engine is being referred to</li>

		<div class="measure">
		<p>
			As all three frameworks are JS libraries that sit on top of WebGL, you can achieve the same things with any of them, with enough effort. It's hard to compare performance without thorough testing, but if the GPU is rendering the same shaders, number of triangles per-frame, and keeping the same textures in memory, the performance across frameworks should be similar. It makes sense then to choose a framework that aligns well with your philosophy, workflow and project intentions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of PlayCanvas's recent focus on archviz it would seem like a good choice for an architectural application. However, as PlayCanvas as a product is heavily focused and invested in its editor, it doesn't make sense to use the engine without the editor, when there are single focus solutions available. Both the editor and engine will be influenced by each other as the product develops. With regards to archviz, PlayCanvas seems more suited to the creation of one-off archviz experiences, rather than the creation of a system for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Goo Engine's main strength is also in its editor. One consideration regarding this is that that puts it in competition with other editors like Unity, and Unreal - who have WebGL exporters, and will possibly the first to utilise new technologies like emscripten and WebAssembly. Goo's declarative approach could be a very real positive, but the API, or at least the documentation, needs some tweaks to lower the barrier to entry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Three.js, being more purpose-agnostic, makes the most sense as the framework to use for an architectural application. It has a smaller core, while still providing more functionality through the available helpers and extras. The addition of big players like Autodesk, who are not just making demos but building applications on top of Three.js, show how dominant it's become. 

			Three.js is not the perfect framework, and it's possible a better designed framework might arise, or that Goo Engine / Play Canvas might pick up enough momuntum to become more feasible as an application framework, but for the near future it represents the safest option. 
		</p>

			</div>
		<p>The scope of this comparison is limited, as a proper comparison would require deeper usage of each framework. As such, several generalisations and assumptions have been made which may be unfair. Pushing the comparison further could involve prototyping a simple app in each of the frameworks. This would be the best way to learn the design patterns each framework encourages, and the strengths and weaknesses that their different approaches bring.
		</p>
		<p>
			All three are fantastic in their own way, it's great to have choices, and great that open source software can be so successful.
